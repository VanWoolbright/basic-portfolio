            <p id="bio">My name is Van Woolbright. I grew up in Florida, but I can't stand hot weather. I have a giant fluffy white dog, aptly named Thor. I regularly reference obscure movie quotes that no one understands. I enjoy hiking, exercise, almost anything outdoors or active, playing guitar, reading, watching movies, photography, and traveling, good beer/wine/coffee (not in that order), and going out with friends. </p>
